   1. Users should be able to send a friend request to other users

   3. Users should be able to accept or decline friend requests
   4. Users should be able to see a list of any user’s friends

### Additional information:
1. Frontend using **Haml** or **Erb**, <span style="color:#AA2020">without</span> **css**
2. No limit on gem usage
3. Do **not** spend more than 120 minutes on your implementation. You do not need to complete all the steps. We are evaluating what you can do in this timeframe and the quality of your work, not necessarily the quantity of code.
   We are looking for well structured and written code, following current Rails best practices. We will not evaluate your view logic. Testing is not a necessity, but will score you bonus points.

   To submit your solution, either
4. Add the project as a public repository on your GitHub account, or
5. Package up your code in a zip file
   Email the repository link or zip file to EMAIL HERE
